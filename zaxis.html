					General Manager – The Americas. Dr. Huang has been involved in developing advanced
					three-dimensional metrology algorithms since 2002. His vast experience includes the use of cutting-edge laser
					holography technology to develop high definition disk-thickness-variation measurements, laser hologram stitching,
					and phase unwrapping measuring at the micron level. He currently holds one US patent “Methods of Combining
					Holograms”. Dr. Huang led the development of several advanced academic research projects for “High Definition
					Metrology and Process: 2µm Manufacturing” under the Precision Manufacturing and Engineering Alliance, funded by US
					National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Advanced Technology Program (ATP), teaming with the
					automotive industry and the University of Michigan. Currently, Dr. Huang serves as the Co-PI for research projects
					funded by US National Science Foundation (NSF). Today, Dr. Huang is intimately involved in Coherix
					Predator3D&#8482 development specifically bringing the voice of the customers to our internal product teams. Dr.
					Huang is highly respected by large global customers and his goal via his blog is to expand awareness and technical
					education regarding the application of machine vision in manufacturing resulting in our customers achieving
					manufacturing excellence and producing defect-free products. Dr. Huang calls it Error Proofing with the Eyes of
					Automation.
